            I’m currently an undergraduate student majoring in business
            administration at the Faculty of Economics and Management Sciences
            (KENMS) of
            <a href="https://iium.edu.my">
              International Islamic University Malaysia (IIUM)

            I was born in Jakarta, Indonesia, as the second son of three
            siblings. Raised in a modest family who taught me to work hard and
            appreciate the value of money from an early age, I then pursue my
            interest in finance industry since I was still in high school by
            learning about stock market and being involved in stock trading.

            Previously, I graduated from Insan Cendekia Boarding School
            (secondary school) with full scholarship from the Ministry of
            Religious Affairs of the Republic of Indonesia.

            Realizing that many of the conventional financial transactions are
            not aligned with the Shari’ah principles, I decided to further my
            study in finance that is compliant with Islamic teachings. In
            attaining my life purpose I believe that focusing more on the
            present day to do things right is more important than thinking too
            far about the future.
